# Investigating the Scala Language Open Source Project

This is a second and bigger project that will showcase exploratory data analysis (EDA) with tools of Data Science with Python.

The main objective of this work is to get some data ready for an EDA and to provide insights from it.

There is no unique research question here. I need to explore an open source project I would like to contribute in: the Scala open source project.

I will try to visualize the evolution of the project and to find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts of a particular file.

Happy reading!
