# Investigating Netflix Movies Duration

This is a first and small project that will showcase basics of data manipulation with Pandas.

The research question is the following:

Does Netflix movies duration decline throughout years ?

To answer that question, I will start by creating a DataFrame containing my friend's data and then visualize the trend that suggest him the research question.

Then, I will use a Netflix dataset to further investigate the movies' duration throughout years.

You will see that despite a small decline in the durations of movies in recent years, there is still lots of hours to entertain yourself watching Netflix movies!
