# Investigating the Android App Market on Google Play

This is my third project. I want to showcase my skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA) with tools of Data Science with Python.

The main objective is to explore comprehensively the Google Play Store apps and reviews.

The business context is the following :

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed.

Therefore, I will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories.

I want to offer for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

The data consist of two files:

    apps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
    user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first

    .

The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.

These three new features will help doing a quick sentiment analysis of app through reviews.

Let's get started!
